second_show = second(s).
deactivated = This link has been deactivated to give you time to check it.
delete_entries = Do you really want to delete all of your saved URLs?
one_gone = was deleted of your list of saved URLs.
alert_redirect = The URL behind this link is not the final destination. You will be redirected to:
redirect = You will be redirected to the following web address:
shorturl = This web address is a so-called ‘short URL’, i.e. it is not the final destination. Clicking on this short URL will redirect you to another web address.
shorturl_short = This web address is not the final destination.
warn = Attention! There is a mismatch between the URL shown in the email and the URL behind the link. This might be a fraud attempt.
warn_short = Attention! There is a mismatch.
wait = This URL is going to be validated. Please wait . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
offline = You seem to be offline. No URL validation possible.
error = Error: There are too many redirections.
description = We can detect if the domain you are about to access redirects you to another link. In most cases, you can't see where the shortened link points to (for example tiny.url, bit.ly). TOrPeDO offers you to evaluate the actual domain automatically, to ask you if you want to use this functionality each time it detects a redirection, or to not use the functionality at all.
warning = The shortened link will be opened by Thunderbird in the background. This makes it possible to find out which URL the shortened link will direct you to. This could  be an illegal website. You, as the user, are liable for any consequences of visiting these sites. Alternatively, you could ask the sender for an extended version of the  link.
phishadvice = Please check the domain (highlighted part) carefully before you click. Additionally you should compare it to the shown domain outside of the tooltip.
redirectadvice = In case you are uncertain whether to click or not, we advice to not click it as criminals often use this to obscure malicious links.
unknownadvice = Please check the domain (highlighted part) carefully and then decide whether you can click it safely or you should delete it.
knownadvice = You should check the URL before clicking even though it is unlikely that it is a dangerous link.
lowrisk = The developers classified the domain (highlighted part) of this URL as low-risk.
userrisk = You classified the domain (highlighted part) of this URL as low-risk.
highrisk = This domain is not yet known or considered by TOrPeDO.
highrisk_short = This domain is not yet known or considered by TOrPeDO.
listofdefaults = Domains the developer considered as low-risk (green)
activategreen = Activate timer on domains the developer considered as low-risk (green)
activateorange = Activate timer on domains you considered as low-risk (blue)
addentries = Add your trustworthy domains here. Only valid URLs and entries with up to 500 characters are accepted. You can add multiple entries at once with a comma.
wrongurl = You tried to add an entry which is not a valid domain.
alreadyinside = You tried to add an entry which is already in the list of trustworthy domains.
alreadyinredirect = You tried to add an entry which is already in the list of redirection domains.
toolong = This entry is too long. Your entry can have up to 500 characters.
alreadyinlist = You tried to add an entry which is already inside this list.
toohigh = This entry is too high. The countdown can be up to 100 seconds long.
infosongreen = A green frame means the domain is considered as low-risk by the developers of TOrPeDO (i.e. employees of TU Darmstadt). We therefore consulted the list of the 200 most visited web pages.
infosonblue = A blue frame means that you considered the domain as low-risk, i.e. a) you have clicked on links with the same domain at least twice since you installed TOrPeDO, b) you have white listed the highlighted domain manually using the TOrPeDO’s settings.
infosonred = The mismatch case means that the target URL and the URL displayed in the text do not match. Additionally the domain is not yet been judged safe or dangerous. In case you are uncertain whether to click or not, we advice to not click it as criminals often use this technique to obscure malicious links.
infosonredirect = The short URL case means that the URL behind this link is not the actual target URL but from this URL you will be re-routed to the actual intended destination. Thus, in order to check whether the link is dangerous, TOrPeDO needs to examine the final destination URL. TOrPeDO deduces this information by using a web-based service. While short URLs may also be used in trustworthy emails, criminals do often use this technique.
infosongmxredirect = The redirection case also means that the URL behind this link is not the actual target URL. In this case, the actual target URL can be deduced from the URL behind the link. Therefore, TOrPeDO displays the information about the actual target domain. The tooltip frame and instructions depends on the consideration of the domain (highlighted part of the URL).
shorttext = Change to short text version
longtext = Change to detailed text version
smalltext = Change to normal text size
bigtext = Change to large text size
