description = We can detect if the domain you are about to access redirects you to another link. In most cases, you can't see where the shortened link points to (for example tiny.url, bit.ly). TOrPeDO offers you to evaluate the actual domain automatically, to ask you if you want to use this functionality each time it detects a redirection, or to not use the functionality at all.
warning = The shortened link  will be opened by Thunderbird in the background. This makes it possible to find out which URL  the shortened link will direct you to. This could  be an illegal website. You, as the user, are liable for any consequences of visiting these sites. Alternatively, you could ask the sender for an extended version of the  link.
check = Check the bold highlighted part of the URL carefully.
